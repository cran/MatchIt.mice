The `matchitmice()` and the `weightitmice()` functions are updated to match and weight imputed datasets, their outputs will be saved in the `mimids` and `wimids` class objects, and the `plot()`, `print()`, and `summary()` functions are updated to be able to provide detailed descriptions of these objects. The `matchitmice.data()` and `weightitmice.data()` functions are added for extracting matched and weighted imputed datasets from the `mimids` and `wimids` class objects and to replace the retired `matchmicedata()` function. The `with()` function now works with the `mimids` and `wimids` class objects and the `pool()` function can be used to pool the obtained results from analyses on each imputed dataset. Examples are simplified and strengthened, the reference manual is updated, the `README.md` and `NEWS.md` files are revised, and plenty of minor bugs are fixed.
